# C basic data types

In the exercises, you will frequently see the following C data types.


| Type        | Explanation          | example  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| int      | an integer with range (from âˆ’2,147,483,648 to +2,147,483,647) | int a = 10; |
| char      | a character      |   char c = 'a'; |
| float | a decimal number      |   float grage = 5.50; |
| Double | a decimal numer      |   double pi = 3.1415926; |

In C, the data type of a variable should be defined before used. Although there are
some way to convert one data type to another, type casting is not suggested.
